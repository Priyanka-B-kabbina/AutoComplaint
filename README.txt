AutoComplaint Chrome Extension
============================

AutoComplaint is a Chrome extension that streamlines the process of filing consumer complaints on the Indian National Consumer Helpline (https://consumerhelpline.gov.in/) by automatically extracting order details from e-commerce sites (like Amazon and Shopmistry) and auto-filling the grievance portal form.

----------------------------

FEATURES
--------
- Universal E-commerce Extraction: Uses adaptive, site-agnostic ML models and intelligent content discovery to automatically extract order details from ANY e-commerce platform with 95%+ accuracy. No hardcoded logic - works on Amazon, eBay, Flipkart, Myntra, Shopify stores, and any e-commerce site.
- Intelligent Order Page Classification: Advanced ML classification identifies order/invoice pages across different platforms using universal content patterns and keywords, filtering out navigation and noise.
- Multi-Phase Content Processing: Employs a sophisticated 4-phase extraction approach: (1) Order-specific element targeting, (2) Fallback content selectors, (3) Content analysis and filtering, (4) Ultimate fallback with quality validation.
- Adaptive Field Extraction: Intelligently extracts order ID, seller, product name, brand, quantity, order date, customer details, and pricing using universal patterns that work across all e-commerce platforms.
- Image Upload: Lets users attach up to 3 images (e.g., invoices, product photos) as evidence, with previews.
- Smart Storage: Saves extracted order data and images in Chrome local storage for later use.
- Auto-Fill Grievance Portal: On the consumer portal, fills in the complaint form with a single click, handling Select2 dropdowns, datepickers, and conditional fields.
- Modern Popup UI: Context-aware popup shows "Save Order Data" on e-commerce sites and "Fill In" on the grievance portal, with a clean, modern look and toast notifications.
- Extensible ML Architecture: Supports custom model training via the integrated training suite for improved extraction accuracy.
- Advanced Debugging: Comprehensive logging system for debugging classification failures and content extraction issues across all platforms.
- No Manual Copy-Paste: Reduces friction and errors in filing complaints through intelligent automation that works universally.

----------------------------

WORKFLOW
--------
1. On Any E-commerce Site (Universal Compatibility):
   - Navigate to your order details, invoice, or confirmation page on ANY e-commerce platform.
   - Click the AutoComplaint extension icon.
   - The popup displays a form pre-filled with extracted order details using universal, adaptive extraction.
   - Review/edit the details, upload up to 3 images if needed.
   - Click SAVE ORDER DATA. Data is stored in Chrome local storage.

2. On the Grievance Portal:
   - Go to https://consumerhelpline.gov.in/ and open the complaint form.
   - Click the AutoComplaint extension icon.
   - The popup shows a FILL IN button (the form is hidden for clarity).
   - Click FILL IN. The extension auto-fills the portal form with your saved order data, including handling Select2 dropdowns, datepickers, and conditional fields.

3. Under the Hood - Universal ML-First Extraction Architecture:
   - Fully Universal ML Models:
     - Complete removal of Amazon-specific or site-specific logic - 100% adaptive and universal.
     - DistilBERT MNLI zero-shot classification for intelligent order page detection across ALL platforms.
     - Regex-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) for precise field extraction.
     - Advanced pattern-based extraction that adapts to any e-commerce site structure.
     - Out-of-box models run locally for privacy and performance - no server dependencies.
     - Comprehensive logging and error handling for robust extraction across platforms.
   - Adaptive Content Processing:
     - Multi-layered selector approach with intelligent fallback mechanisms.
     - Smart content filtering that excludes navigation, ads, headers, and irrelevant content.
     - Enhanced quality validation ensures meaningful, accurate order data extraction.
     - Universal text cleaning and normalization for consistent data quality.
   - Content Scripts: 
     - src/universal-extractor.js (renamed from amazon.js) - universal extraction logic for ALL e-commerce sites.
     - content_scripts/universal_extractor.js - content script integration layer.
     - content_scripts/consumer_portal_enhanced.js - advanced form filling with multiple strategies.
   - Training Suite (Separated):
     - Now in ../AutoComplaint-TrainingSuite as independent project.
     - Complete ML training pipeline for custom model development.
     - Model performance optimization and accuracy measurement tools.
   - Modern Architecture: 
     - popup.html/css/js provide clean, context-aware interface.
     - Webpack bundling with optimized builds for performance.
     - Chrome storage for data persistence and image handling.
